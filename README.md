* Landing gear drag seems too minimal (hard to slow down)
* Cowl flaps don’t produce any drag (not noticeable in airspeed)
* Prop feathering has no effect (check POH) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpQwnOIoJI] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpQwnOIoJI) NOT CURRENTLY MODELED IN SIM
* Differential thrust on the ground helps you turn, that’s not modeled.
* Fuel pump sound missing
* Prop Drag
