* Changed batteries amp hours to reflect reality, 13ah [p339, POH]
* Changed battery discharge curve to match deep cycle lead acid battery
* Changed alternator curve to match real unit, changed alternator rated voltage to match real unit

* @willisxdc - Performance https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/pros-and-cons-of-the-baron-g58/335280/13 BUT GOOD POST ABOUT CLIMB PERF

Taken from forum post https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/pros-and-cons-of-the-baron-g58/335280

* Landing gear drag seems too minimal (hard to slow down)
* Cowl flaps don’t produce any drag (not noticeable in airspeed)
* Prop feathering has no effect (check POH) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpQwnOIoJI] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpQwnOIoJI) NOT CURRENTLY MODELED IN SIM
* Differential thrust on the ground helps you turn, that’s not modeled.
* Fuel pump sound missing
* Prop Drag
* Seats and weight distribution
